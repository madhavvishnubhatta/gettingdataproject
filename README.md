##The goal of the run_analysis.R is:

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. use descriptive labels for all the variables
5. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
